# Mini Bank Python Project 
This python project is about simulating the system of a bank. This program stores user info stored in a file. While the program is running, the program reads from and writes to the file the details of the users of this bank system. The file stores the user's account number, how much the user has in the bank plus the first and last name of the user. When running the program, the user is presented with options to choose from.
